### What is _project Tomotoru_?
> Tomotoru is a Sanrio official game, game which server's have been shut down and are now sadly inaccessible, prompting the error right in the main screen.
### What is our task?
> The task is to make new alternative working servers for the Tomotoru game, so we can bring it back to life finally.
> The goal: Create alternative servers by checking the game's logistics and whats needed for it to run properly, making sure everything is compatible and working alright.
